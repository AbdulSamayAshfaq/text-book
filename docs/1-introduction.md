# Chapter 1: Introduction to AI and Robotics

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that aims to create machines capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include:

- Learning from experience
- Recognizing patterns
- Understanding language
- Making decisions
- Solving problems

## What is Robotics?

Robotics is the engineering discipline that designs and builds robots - autonomous or semi-autonomous machines that can interact with the physical world. Modern robots can:

- Perceive their environment through sensors
- Process information using AI algorithms
- Take actions through actuators (motors, grippers, etc.)
- Learn and adapt to new situations

## The Convergence of AI and Robotics

When AI and robotics combine, we create intelligent machines that can:

- Understand complex environments
- Make autonomous decisions
- Learn from their experiences
- Collaborate with humans
- Perform tasks in unstructured environments

## Why Does This Matter?

The convergence of AI and robotics is reshaping industries:

- **Manufacturing**: Automated assembly with quality control
- **Healthcare**: Surgical robots and rehabilitation devices
- **Logistics**: Autonomous warehouses and delivery systems
- **Exploration**: Rovers on Mars, underwater drones
- **Service**: Humanoid robots for assisted living and hospitality

## Learning Objectives
