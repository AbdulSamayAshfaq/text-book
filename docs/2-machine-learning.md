# Chapter 2: Machine Learning Fundamentals

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of AI where computers learn patterns from data without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following step-by-step instructions, ML systems:

- Learn from examples (training data)
- Identify patterns and relationships
- Make predictions on new, unseen data
- Improve performance over time

## Three Types of Machine Learning

### Supervised Learning

The computer learns from labeled examples - data where the correct answer is already known.

Examples:
- Image classification (is this a cat or dog?)
- Email spam detection
- House price prediction
- Medical diagnosis

### Unsupervised Learning

The computer finds patterns in unlabeled data without being told what to look for.

Examples:
- Customer segmentation
- Document clustering
- Anomaly detection
- Recommendation systems

### Reinforcement Learning

The computer learns by interacting with an environment, receiving rewards or penalties for actions.

Examples:
- Game-playing AI
- Robot control and navigation
- Autonomous driving
- Resource optimization

## The Machine Learning Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather relevant training data
2. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the data
3. **Feature Engineering**: Select relevant characteristics
4. **Model Selection**: Choose an appropriate algorithm
5. **Training**: Fit the model to the training data
6. **Evaluation**: Test performance on new data
7. **Deployment**: Use the model in production
8. **Monitoring**: Track performance and retrain as needed

## Neural Networks: Brain-Inspired Learning

Neural networks are algorithms inspired by biological neurons in the brain. They consist of:

- **Input Layer**: Receives data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process information
- **Output Layer**: Makes predictions

Neural networks learn by adjusting weights (connection strengths) through a process called backpropagation.

## Deep Learning

Deep Learning uses neural networks with many layers (hence "deep"). This allows:

- Learning hierarchical representations
- Handling very complex patterns
- Achieving state-of-the-art results in many domains

Applications:
- Computer vision (image recognition)
- Natural language processing (language translation, chatbots)
- Speech recognition
- Game playing

## Learning Objectives

1. Understand the three main ML paradigms
2. Know the general ML workflow
3. Appreciate how neural networks learn
4. Recognize when deep learning is appropriate
